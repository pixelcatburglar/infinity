# Database

The database has four schemas:

- `sde` holds the typed, indexed static data tables.
- `sde_native` and `sde_compat` hold the raw static data bundles, one `jsonb` table per file.
- `game` holds everything players create: accounts, characters, items, the market, mail and so on.

`game.crate_rewards` records one receipt per reward item ID, with the opening character, crate type, destination location and flag, opening FILETIME and nullable first-confirmation FILETIME. Receipts are written in the same transaction as the reward items. They have no foreign key to items and survive a reward item's deletion or merge.

Lifecycle:

- **First start.** `scripts/db-init.sh` loads `db/<schema>/<table>.sql.gz` into an empty volume. Tables whose foreign keys aren't satisfied yet are retried until everything is loaded.
- **Every server start.** The server applies `crates/server/sql/game_schema.sql`, loads the captured retail prices, and seeds the NPC market if it is empty. It then reads the static data it uses from `sde`, `sde_native` and `sde_compat` into memory once; after startup the server never queries those schemas, so static data changes take effect at the next start. Scheduled jobs are kept in `game.jobs`: jobs that fell due while the server was down run right after the start, and a job left half-done by a crash runs again once its lease expires, so every job must be safe to repeat.
- **Reset.** Remove the database volume to start over (`docker compose down`, then `docker volume rm infinity_pgdata`). The next `docker compose up` imports the dumps again.
- **Rebuild the static data.** Put the static data JSONL bundles (`eve-online-client-static-data-<build>-jsonl` and `eve-online-static-data-<build>-jsonl`) under `./sde/`, run `docker compose run --rm sde-import`, then restart the server.
- **Refresh the dumps.** `scripts/db-dump.ps1` replaces the folders under `db/` with dumps of the running database.
